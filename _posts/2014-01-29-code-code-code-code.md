Well, since I didn't post an update last night, I guess I will post it today. I spent the entire evening and night
cranking out code last night, worked more on it today and made a lot of progress. I have mostly completed the
project loader and I'm implementing the project browser now. There are some quirky things about the way Netbeans
handles communication between normal classes and windows so I'm overcoming a tiny inconvenience. Once the project
browser is done I can start working on the mapping bit and update the world, yet again.
