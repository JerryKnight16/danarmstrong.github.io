So, just a quick update. I'm changing the name of the engine and studio. After digging around more,
the ABYSS Engine is a product of Fish Labs. There is no point in fighting over names and all of that,
so I decided to rename my product. Better to do it early, and I've been looking into this since I
started the product. I wanted a name that is fun, quirky and... me. So, in the near future, I will
unveil the new site, domain, and all that good stuff. Stay tuned!
