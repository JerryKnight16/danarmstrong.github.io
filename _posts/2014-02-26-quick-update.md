No updates for far too long! I know, I know. I have recently brought another guy on-board and
we are currently building our new site, on a new host, with the fancy new name of IndieUnicorn.
We are also switching our focus in several areas. For starters, we are considering alternatives
to Corona SDK since their free version is pretty restrictive. We are looking at both Phaser and
Loom SDK. I'm really impressed with both and Loom is very cheap at $5/mo. Phaser is free but only
used to make HTML5 games. Still, it is a great choice.

The studio has been switched from Java to C++/Qt and development on it temporarily halted while
we decide on a specific framework. Hopefully the new site will be finished soon enough and online.
When that happens, you will be redirected to the new location. In the meantime, keep checking back!
