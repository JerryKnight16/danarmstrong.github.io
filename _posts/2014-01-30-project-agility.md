I want to take a minute talk about development practices. I know that this topic has
been beat into the ground all over the internet, but I will try to keep it short and
specific to Abyss. I come from an enterprise background, and that requires really
tight schedules and strict deadlines. To help achieve these unrealistic goals, I have
always been stuck using the Agile methodology. The terms Agile and Sprints will
generally make any developer cringe, but they really are important concepts. Keeping
with my best practices, Abyss will be developed in an Agile fashion. For now, I will
try to plan in three week sprints, and I will plan one sprint ahead. 

I'm using Github as my sprint management platform. I will create a new milestone for
each sprint and I have created a "user story" label in my issues for writing my
user stories. As I populate this information, I will assign each user story to a
sprint and try my hardest to knock the backlog out. You will notice the progress
link in the menu. Clicking that will take you to the Abyss Studio Waffle.io page.
If you have never used Waffle.io, it is perfect for agile development since it 
allows greater control over Github issue flows and I find it to be much  nicer of an 
interface to stare at as well.

I urge you guys to head over to the repository by clicking the Abyss Studio button on
the homepage and start entering user stories/feature requests. This will help me
prioritize things much more quickly and allow me to spend more time writing code and
less time planning. Of course, if anyone has any questions about how Agile development
works or how it can be used in your own projects, don't be afraid to leave a comment
and ask. I am always happy to share knowledge with others!
